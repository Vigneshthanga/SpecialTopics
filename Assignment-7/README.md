# Gradient Boosting Machines
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. 

Overview of Model
=================
1) 30 sequential trees

Requirements
============
Our model requires fastai and pandas

How to Run / Alter Code
=======================
1) Run GBM.ipynb
